# Ruby Lambda

Like procs, lambdas are objects. The similarities donâ€™t stop there: with the exception of a bit of syntax and a few behavioral quirks, lambdas are identical to procs.

Check out the code in the editor. See the lambda bit? Typing
```ruby
lambda { puts "Hello!" }
```
Is just about the same as
```ruby
Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }
```
In the example to the right, when we pass the lambda to lambda_demo, the method calls the lambda and executes its code.
