# PROCS


Procs are great for keeping your code DRY, which stands for Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself. With blocks, you have to write your code out each time you need it; with a proc, you write your code once and can use it many times!

## Example Code

```script.rb```

```ruby
multiples_of_3 = Proc.new do |n|
  n % 3 == 0
end

print (1..100).to_a.select(&multiples_of_3)
```
```console
[3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99]
```
