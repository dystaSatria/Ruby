# Include

We can do more than just require a module, however. We can also include it!

Any class that includes a certain module can use those moduleâ€™s methods!

A nice effect of this is that you no longer have to prepend your constants and methods with the module name. Since everything has been pulled in, you can simply write PI instead of Math::PI.

## Example

```script.rb```
```rb
class Angle
  include Math
  attr_accessor :radians
  
  def initialize(radians)
    @radians = radians
  end
  
  def cosine
    cos(@radians)
  end
end

acute = Angle.new(1)
acute.cosine
```
